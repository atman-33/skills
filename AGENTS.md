# Agent Skills Registry

This repository serves as a registry for Agent Skills.

## Purpose
To manage and organize skills that extend the capabilities of AI agents.

## Instructions for AI Agents

### 1. Skill Structure
Each skill is located in its own directory and contains a `SKILL.md` file.

### 2. Creating and Editing Skills
When creating or editing a skill, you MUST follow the guidelines defined in:
[.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md](.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)

### 3. Metadata Requirements
The `name` and `description` fields in `SKILL.md` are critical.
- **name**: Must be concise and unique.
- **description**: Must clearly explain *when* and *why* an agent should use this skill. This ensures correct skill selection during task execution.
