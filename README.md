# Agent Skills Registry

This repository hosts a collection of **Agent Skills** designed to extend the capabilities of AI agents.

## Overview

Each directory in this repository represents a distinct skill that provides specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations for the agent. These skills are loaded on-demand to assist with specific tasks.

## Structure

- **Skill Folders**: Each folder corresponds to a single skill.
- **SKILL.md**: Every skill folder contains a `SKILL.md` file defining the skill's metadata, instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Creating and Editing Skills

To add a new skill or modify an existing one, please refer to the guidelines in the `.system/skill-creator` directory.
Ensure that every new skill includes a valid `SKILL.md` with the required `name` and `description` metadata.
